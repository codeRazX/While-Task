# Task Manager

This **Task Manager** is a modern and easy-to-use application designed to help you efficiently manage your projects and tasks. With a **smooth, beautiful, and simple interface**, you can manage all your tasks intuitively, from creation to completion.

## Key Features

- **Task creation and management**: You can create new tasks or projects and manage them easily.
- **Notes per task**: Each task or project can have attached notes, allowing you to add additional details for tracking.
- **Priority control**: You can assign a priority to each task: **high**, **medium**, or **low**.
- **Creation date**: All tasks are registered with the date they were created.
- **Due date**: You can add a due date to tasks, and once the date has passed, the task will automatically be marked as **completed**. Additionally, the interface will display the remaining time until the due date.
- **Status change**: You can change the status of your tasks to **pending**, **in progress**, or **completed**.
- **Task editing**: You can edit any task through the task menu or the edit modal that opens when you click on the task or the view menu.

- **Sorting**: Tasks and projects are automatically sorted by **priority** and **creation date**.
- **Valid due date**: When setting a due date, it is not possible to select a past date to avoid logical errors. You can choose a **date only**, a **time only**, or a **date with time**.
